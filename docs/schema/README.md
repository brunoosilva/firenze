# Schema

Schema class is responsible for exposing methods for manipulating the database schema, like dropping and creating tables for example.

It made its way into the project in v0.3, for abstracting the responsibilities of fixtures in tests mainly.

The class is intended to be primarily used by Adapters internally only.
